# ECEN-Projects
This is a repository of my various passion projects in their differing states of completion.

The most ambitious of all the projects (and one of my favorite) is a retropie project to build a pokedex. On the software side, this will incorporate image recognition for a real pokedex function. Additionally, it will contain a custom build of retropie+emulationstation that includes an On-Screen-Keyboard (OSK) and custom drivers for Battery Monitoring and digital inputs to control the system

I also have records and CAD Files of my other projects. In an effort to consolidate my efforts instead of take on a bunch of projects at once (and stretch myself thin), I am focusing solely on one project at a time for the forseeable future.
